To-Do List App 

A To-Do List App capable of 

- Adding A To-Do 
- List All To-Dos 
- Toggle a To-Do as Completed or Not 
- Filter To-Dos based on status 

Installation 

This project uses the project starter for lit-element and lit-html from vaadin.com and was heavily based from the tutorial for a To-Do List app on their website. 

https://vaadin.com/tutorials/lit-element/starting-a-lit-element-project


Once in the directory of the project run:

npm install 

This should install necessary components for the project but if some dependencies are missing, manually install lit-element and the vaadin checkbox:

npm install --save lit-element

npm install --save @vaadin/vaadin-checkbox 



Once installation is complete, to startup the development server, run: 

npm run dev 

then navigate to http://localhost:8080 on your browser.

If everything went well, the application should be up and running. 


This Project was Built With 

- Sublime Text Editor 2 
- Vaadin Project Starter
- Standardjs 
- Chrome for Project testing
